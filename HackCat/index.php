        <h1>HackCat</h1>
        <p>
          HackCat was the game me and a group of my friends developed for the
          HackSussex 2024 GameJam, a programming competition at the University
          of Sussex. The competition tasked us with creating a game within
          24 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          HackCat won us the overall prize for the competition, we were all very happy with what we managed
          to produce in this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Huge credit to my team members for this project, not only for the work they did on the project
          itself, for keeping me sane throughout the seemingly endless merge conflicts:

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          We were inspired by a couple of games, such as Slay the Spire and One Step from Eden!
        </p>

        <h2>What it does</h2>
        <p>
          This game contains several procedural encounters with enemies as you travel from ship to ship in order to hack the mothership!
        </p>

        <h2>How we built it</h2>
        <p>
          we built this game in Unity and did a lot of scripting and asset making (Except for the font which was from DaFontme). Every asset was handmade as well as every line of code.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
        <p>
          Many merge conflicts, however these were resolved within a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, due to there being several coders integrating all of the code was difficult however everyone was able to integrate it in the end!
          Accomplishments that we're proud of
        </p>
        <p>
          We made what we believe to be an incredible game in the time allocated to us. Furthermore we are very proud of our teamwork in general!
          What we learned
        </p>
        <p>
          We learnt how to use Unity effectively as well as how to use Gimp, as well as several other asset making things!
        </p>

        <h2>What's next for HackCat</h2>
        <p>
          In the future we may work on adding new enemies and bosses! As well as additional cards and potentially different player characters (With their own abilities)
